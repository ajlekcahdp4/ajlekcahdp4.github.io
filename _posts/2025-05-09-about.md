## Background
I've been programming since 2021, starting as a CS student at
[MIPT](https://eng.mipt.ru/), and gradually falling into the rabithole of
Linux and machine code. Currently working as a software engineer doing 
primarily C++ and low-level programming. In 2023 I learned about
[Nix](https://nixos.org/) and after a few months switched to NixOS on all of
my machines (Including grandma's PC actually). Through that I developed
a hobby of managing Linux servers (currenly working on several
VPS and local machines).

## Fields of Interest

- C++
- Nix
- Software architecture
- RISC-V

## Personal projects

### llvm-bleach

I'm currently working on machine code lifter called
[llvm-bleach](https://github.com/ajlekcahdp4/llvm-bleach) which allows to lift
any machine code to LLVM IR to further analyze and compile for different
architectures. It's great and allows extremely high level of flexibility but
is still in very early development stages.

### Various homelab projects
